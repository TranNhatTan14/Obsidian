Icelandic DNA tells a story of Viking colonization and plunder across the Northern Atlantic.

- In the first lesson of this chapter, we began to trace back the ancestry of related species by tracking the changes in protein and DNA sequences.
- In a given gene of the _E. coli_ genome, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations occur rarely. Sometimes these mutations persist in the population and turn up in individual samples taken hundreds of generations later, but most of the time the mutation is transient, disappearing just as rapidly as it appeared.

## Genetic drift

The appearance of SNPs can be treated as a random process which occur at a certain rate μ per nucleotide per generation. 

In the last 20 years, we begun to map the set of the SNPs in millions of people from populations around the world.

Capturing one individual's set of SNPs compared to a reference genome is called **genotyping**.

Considering only these eight C amino acids, how many possible arrangements of four bridges can appear in this enzyme?

We can enumerate all the different arrangements of C amino acids by thinking through how to construct one random arrangement.
