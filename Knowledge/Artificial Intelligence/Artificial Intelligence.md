- Introduction to AI Trends in 2025
- The video introduces the topic of AI trends in 2025.
- The speaker shares their educated guesses on the most important trends.
- The speaker mentions that they previously predicted AI trends for 2024 and did alright.

- Agentic AI
	- Agentic AI refers to intelligence systems that can reason, plan, and take action.
	- These systems can break down complex problems into multi-step plans and interact with tools and databases.
	- However, current models struggle with consistent logical reasoning.

- Inference Time Compute
	- Inference time compute refers to the process of a model processing real-time data and comparing it to its training data.
	- This process can be tuned and improved without retraining the model.
	- This trend is interesting because it allows for better reasoning and decision-making.

- Very Large Models
	- Many parameters refined over the training process.
	- These models are expected to be many times larger than current models, with up to 50 trillion parameters.
	- However, larger models may not always be better, and smaller models may be more efficient.

- Very Small Models
	- Very small models are models that are only a few billion parameters in size.
	- These models can run on laptops or phones without requiring large compute overhead.
	- These models can be tuned to complete specific tasks without requiring large data centers.

- More Advanced Use Cases
	- More advanced use cases for AI include customer service bots that can solve complex problems.
	- AI systems that can proactively optimize entire IT networks.
	- Security tools that can adapt to new threats in real-time.

- Near Infinite Memory
	- Near infinite memory refers to the ability of models to keep everything they know about us in memory at all times.
	- This trend is approaching, with models having context windows measured in hundreds of thousands or millions of tokens.
	- This will enable customer service chatbots to recall every conversation they have had with us.

- Human-in-the-loop Augmentation
	- Human-in-the-loop augmentation refers to the collaboration between humans and AI systems.
	- This trend is important because it can lead to better decision-making and problem-solving.
	- However, current systems require professionals to be experts in using AI, which can be a limitation.
