# Inference engine

Inference engine is a part of artificial intelligence systems that helps make decisions or solve problems by analyzing information and applying rules. It works like a brain, taking in data and using logical steps to draw conclusions. Inference engines are used in expert systems, chatbots, and recommendation systems

- GPU/AI specific Hardware
	- NVIDIA (CUDA, Triton Inference Server using either vLLM/TensorRT-LLM Backends)
	- AMD (ROCm), AMD Ryzen AI.
	- Intel Arc (sycl, Big DL, Intel Extensions for Transformers), Intel NPU
	- Apple Metal/CoreML

### Modular
### TensorRT-LLM
###  llama.cpp

### vLLM

A high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs

[[Natural Language Processing]]

Acquire several different data souces of different types and store that data on database

- Implement a module that fetches some data
    - csv
    - Upload data to database

In this case you are doing data engineering as opposed to ML engineering. While ML engineering isn't just about tuning hyper-parameters, it will involve deploying and monitoring the models as well. Most companies though have a shortage of software engineers/data-engineers which leads the ML engineers/data-scientists to become more self-sufficient in generating the required data. It also helps that software engineers tend to have little clue about the data they need to process and hence sometimes a more end-to-end focussed work is more efficient.
