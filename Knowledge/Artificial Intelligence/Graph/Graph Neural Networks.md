# Graph Neural Networks

Graph are a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships and interactions within data. They allow us to represent entities as nodes and their interactions as edge, making them invaluable for a wide range of application (social network, healthcare, genetics).

Key components of GNNs:
- Node features: each node in the graph has associated features that provide contextual information.
- Edge features: Edges can also have features that describe the nature of the relationship between nodes.
