# Definition

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method used to study brain activity by recording electrical signals produced by the brain. Itâ€™s done using a cap or electrodes placed on the scalp. The result of this process is called an electroencephalogram (EEG graph), which looks like wavy lines showing brain signals.
