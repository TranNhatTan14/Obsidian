# Tools

## Cognitive tools

**Cognitive tools** are mental strategies or techniques that aid in thinking, understanding, learning, and problem-solving. They help people process and organize information more efficiently and creatively, making it easier to grasp complex concepts or make decisions.

### Analogy

### Mind map

Visual diagrams that organize information around a central idea, helping to structure thoughts and make connections between concepts.

### Heuristics

Mental shortcuts or rules of thumb used to make decisions quickly (e.g., "if something is expensive, it must be good").

### Metaphors

Comparisons used to explain or describe something by referring to it as something else (e.g., "time is a thief" to describe how quickly time passes).

### Checklists

Simple, structured lists to ensure that key steps in a process are not overlooked, often used to enhance focus and reduce errors.
    
### Visualization 

Creating mental images or diagrams to represent complex information, improving comprehension and recall.
