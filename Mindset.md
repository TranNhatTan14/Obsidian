A mindset is an established set of attitudes of a person or group concerning culture, values, philosophy, frame of mind, outlook, and disposition. It may also arise from a person's worldview or beliefs about the meaning of life.

Mindset refers to the established set of attitudes, beliefs, and assumptions that shape how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It influences how individuals interpret and respond to situations, challenges, and opportunities in their lives.

- Yêu bản thân mình của hiện tại, hàng ngày là hệ thống phản hồi để mình có thể phát triển và tối ưu bản thân hơn
- Nhìn sự vật, sự việc từ nhiều chiều, mặc dù chúng ta không thể thấy được hết các khía cạnh nhưng ta có thể hiểu được 80% [[PCA]]
- Giỏi thì mới cạnh tranh và phát triển được

Am I alright No. Might will be okaaay Of course
Cuộc đời không công bằng, có người cả đời đi trên con đường lởm chởm, có người chạy thục mạng cuối đường lại là vách đá

Những thứ mình làm, mình đều học được kiến thức mới
Tận hưởng cuộc sống, mỗi ngày phát triển bản thân hơn, đón nhận những khó khăn khuyết điểm.

# List of mindsets

A success-oriented mindset is crucial for achieving goals and realizing one's potential. Here are key elements of a mindset geared towards success:

### Growth Mindset

Believe that abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort, learning, and persistence. View challenges as opportunities to grow rather than insurmountable obstacles.
### Resilience

Develop the ability to bounce back from setbacks and failures. See them as temporary and as learning experiences rather than permanent defeats.
### Goal-Oriented

Set clear, achievable goals and create actionable plans to reach them. Maintain focus on long-term objectives while working on short-term tasks.
### Positive Self-Talk

Cultivate an inner dialogue that is encouraging and supportive. Replace negative self-talk with constructive and motivating thoughts.
### Continuous Learning

Embrace a lifelong commitment to learning and self-improvement. Stay curious and open to new ideas and perspectives.
### Accountability

Take responsibility for your actions and outcomes. Avoid blaming external factors for failures or setbacks.
### Adaptability

Be flexible and willing to adjust strategies when faced with changing circumstances. Embrace change as an opportunity rather than a threat.
### Perseverance

Develop grit and determination to push through difficulties and stay committed to your goals, even when faced with obstacles.
### Solution-Focused

Instead of dwelling on problems, focus on finding solutions. Approach challenges with a "how can I" attitude rather than a "why can't I" mentality.
### Abundance Mentality

Believe that there are enough resources and opportunities for everyone. This fosters collaboration and reduces fear-based decision-making.
### Self-Efficacy

Cultivate a strong belief in your ability to succeed and accomplish your goals. This confidence often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
### Gratitude

Regularly acknowledge and appreciate what you have. This positive focus can boost motivation and resilience.

To develop this success-oriented mindset:

- Practice self-reflection to identify limiting beliefs
- Surround yourself with positive, successful people
- Read books and listen to podcasts on personal development
- Set challenging but achievable goals regularly
- Celebrate small wins along the way to larger goals
- Learn from failures and setbacks instead of being discouraged by them
