# Yes

## Data Scientist

- Analyzes and interprets complex data to provide insights and build AI models.
- Assess the performance of the machine learning model according to the performance requirements
- Develop and implement ML model to solve specific bussiness problems
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to make sure the model training process is optimized

Understanding Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is essential for any data scientist, engineer, or leader to ==take machine learning models from a local notebook to a functioning model in production==. This course introduces you to the key processes, phases, and levels of MLOps, including ==design, development, deployment, and monitoring==. You'll discover how ==automation== enables organizations to efficiently launch, monitor, and update their machine learning models.
