# Workflow
## Data Preparation

Data Acquisition

- Obtain raw short-read sequencing data in FASTQ format. This can be from local files or downloaded from public repositories like NCBI SRA or ENA.
	- More detail abour read length, coverage, depth

Quality Control

- Perform quality control steps to remove low-quality reads, adapters, and contaminants using tools like fastp, BBDuk, or fastp (from our conversation). This ensures the accuracy of downstream analyses.

Genome Assembly

- Assemble the short reads into contigs using assemblers like SPAdes, Unicycler, or SKESA, which produce assembly graphs.

Unitig Extraction

Extract unitigs from the assembly graph. Unitigs represent unique stretches of DNA and offer a higher resolution of connectivity information compared to contigs. Assemblers like metaSPAdes and metaFlye can directly generate unitig-level assembly graphs. 

Assembly Graph Preparation

Construct a unitig-level assembly graph, where nodes represent unitigs and edges represent overlaps between them. This graph will be used as input for the Graph Transformer model.

## Feature Engineering 

- Node Features: Extract relevant features for each unitig (node in the graph). Some crucial features include:
	- Coverage Depth: The number of reads covering each unitig, often normalized by the average coverage. Higher coverage may indicate plasmid origin.
	- GC Content: The proportion of guanine and cytosine bases in the unitig sequence. Plasmids can exhibit different GC content compared to chromosomes.
	- k-mer Frequencies: The frequencies of specific k-mer patterns within the unitig sequence. Certain k-mers might be indicative of plasmid sequences, particularly those associated with AMR genes.
	- Protein Domain Profiles: Predict protein-coding sequences using tools like Prodigal and identify protein domains using databases like Pfam. The presence of plasmid-specific protein domains can be a strong indicator of plasmid origin.
	- Graph-Based Features: Compute features that capture the connectivity of each unitig within the assembly graph. Examples include:
	- Degree: The number of edges connected to the unitig node.
	- Betweenness Centrality:  A measure of how often a node lies on the shortest path between other nodes. High betweenness may indicate important connector unitigs.
	- Clustering Coefficient: A measure of how interconnected the neighbors of a node are.

- Edge Features: Extract features that represent the relationships between connected unitigs in the assembly graph. Examples include:
	- Overlap Length: The number of overlapping bases between two unitigs.
	- Overlap Identity: The percentage of identical bases in the overlapping region.
	- Edge Weight: Can be based on overlap length, identity, or a combination of both, reflecting the strength of the connection.

## Model Training 

### Model Selection

- Choose a Graph Transformer model architecture suitable for the task. Several sparse and efficient transformer architectures have been proposed for graphs, such as Exphormer.

- Data Split: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring a balanced representation of plasmid and chromosomal unitigs.
- Hyperparameter Tuning:  Optimize the model's hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of layers, attention heads) using the validation set to achieve the best performance.
- Training: Train the Graph Transformer model on the training set, using the extracted node and edge features. The model learns to classify unitigs as plasmid or chromosomal based on their features and graph connectivity.

## Plasmid Identification and Validation

- Prediction: Apply the trained model to the test set to predict the probability of each unitig originating from a plasmid.
- Thresholding:  Choose a probability threshold to classify unitigs as plasmid or chromosomal. Optimize this threshold based on the desired balance between precision and recall.
- Contig Grouping: Group unitigs classified as plasmids into distinct plasmid components. This can be achieved by analyzing the connected components in the graph or using clustering algorithms.
- Validation: Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics, including:
	- Accuracy: The overall proportion of correctly classified unitigs.
	- Precision:  The proportion of true plasmid unitigs among those predicted as plasmids.
	- Recall: The proportion of true plasmid unitigs that are correctly predicted as plasmids.
	- F1-score: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of performance.
- Comparison with Other Tools: Compare the results with other plasmid identification tools like PlasmidFinder, MOB-Suite, Platon, plasmidVerify, PlasForest, Deeplasmid, gplas, gplas2, and plasmidEC to assess the model's performance.

### Post-Processing and Analysis

- Plasmid Reconstruction: If possible, attempt to reconstruct complete plasmid sequences from the identified plasmid contigs. This might require additional steps like gap filling, scaffolding, and resolving repeat regions.
- Functional Annotation: Annotate the predicted plasmid sequences to identify genes and functional elements, particularly those related to replication, mobility, and AMR. 
- Comparative Analysis:  Compare identified plasmids with reference databases to assess their novelty, similarity to known plasmids, and potential AMR risks.
- Visualization: Visualize the assembly graph, highlighting predicted plasmid components and key features. This can aid in understanding the plasmid structure and relationships between different contigs.

### Important Considerations

- Short Contig Handling: Short contigs pose a significant challenge for plasmid identification. Consider using specialized techniques or tools designed for handling short contigs, like PLASMe.
- Taxonomic Specificity:  Be mindful of the taxonomic specificity of training data and databases used. The model's performance may vary across different bacterial species.
- Choice of Assembler:  The choice of assembler can impact the quality of the assembly graph, which in turn affects plasmid identification.
- Threshold Optimization: Carefully select probability thresholds for classification to balance precision and recall based on the specific application and the consequences of false positives or negatives.

This checklist offers a comprehensive guide to identifying plasmids from short-read sequencing data using a unitig-level assembly graph and a Graph Transformer model. By carefully following these steps and considering the highlighted points, you can improve the accuracy and reliability of your plasmid identification process.
