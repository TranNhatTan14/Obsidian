# Q&A

==What are transcriptome-wide association studies?==

Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is **an instrumental post-analysis to detect significant gene-trait associations focusing on modeling transcription-level regulations**, which has made numerous progresses in recent years

==What is the difference between GWAS and TWAS?==

However, GWAS faces challenges like multiple testing corrections and difficulties in pinpointing causal variants. Conversely, **TWAS offers higher gene resolution and the potential for deeper insights into genetic mechanisms**.
