We'll explore the building blocks of quantum computers and how the unique properties of quantum mechanics can enable a completely new type of information processing.

Much as classical computation uses bits, quantum computation usesÂ **qubits**, isolated quantum objects that behave quantum mechanically, with two or more states that can be distinguished with a measurement.
