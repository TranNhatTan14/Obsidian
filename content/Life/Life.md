###### Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

- Học hỏi từ những người đi trước
- Giống như đi trên con đường đã được xây dựng, mình cần biết những gì cho phép, những sai lầm gì từ người đi trước

Not life change and you can change with it, It not about what happens to you, it’s how you react
In life, there are things we can’t control, just like the wind. But here’s the empowering part: we have the ability to adapt and change our course. It’s like adjusting the sails of a boat—we can always find a way to navigate through challenges and rough waters. So, when life throws curveballs, remember: you may not control the wind, but you’re the captain of your ship. Adjust those sails and keep sailing towards your dreams!

### Productivity

- You can read faster than you can speak, avoid **subvocalizaion** with humming or counting silently
- The quickest way to learn more complex vocabulary is also the most fun: **read more, keep a list**
- Trình bày những thứ phức tạp một cách dễ hiểu

### Memory

- **Limit external distraction** to listen more effectively and increase the chances that you'll remember what you hear
- **Chunking strategy**, which help memorization by breaking down long information into smaller parts
- If you formulate questions as you listen to new information, you have a better chance of remembering it.
- To help yourself recall new information, try to link it to a personal experience or something you already know.
- Sitting up straight and maintaining good posture while listening can help improve your retention.
- Listen without judging or jumping to conclusions to better understand and remember what you hear.

###### Self

- Right place values you in right way, so don't stay in a place where nobody sees your value
    
    Đặt bản thân mình vào đúng vị trí, đừng bắt cá leo cây
    
    - [ ] Find your values
    - [ ] Find the right place
