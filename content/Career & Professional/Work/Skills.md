### Programming

Delve into advanced concept such as OOP and Algorithm optimization.

Understanding how to write efficient, scalable code is crucial since AI applications often process large amounts of data. 

Practice by contributing to open-source projects or tackling complex problems that challenge your coding skills.

- Writing clean, efficient, and scalable code.
- Understand the principles of software engineering, including version control, testing, and debugging. 

### Data

Data is the lifeblood of AI. You must be adept at data preprocessing, which includes cleaning and normalizing data to ensure that your AI models are trained on high-quality datasets. 

###### Data Preprocessing

Cleaning and normalizing data to ensure AI models are trained on high-quality datasets

###### Data Manipulation Tools

Acquire skills in using tools that facilitate efficient data manipulation.

###### Database Management Systems

 Understand the workings and management of database systems to support robust AI solutions.

Learning to use data manipulation tools and understanding database management systems are also valuable skills. 

By mastering data handling, you'll ensure that your AI solutions are built on solid ground, leading to more accurate outcomes.

Learn to use tools like SQL, pandas, and Hadoop for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

Gain experience in handling big data, including knowledge of distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Spark, to manage and process large datasets effectively.
