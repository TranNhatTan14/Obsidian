Mục tiêu cụ thể khi lựa chọn công việc dựa trên [[IKIGAI]]
Lên danh sách các lĩnh vực mà mình muốn làm việc

Goal is learn from AI and work with AI, thu nhập tốt giúp mình lo được cho bản thân và cho gia đình

1. Công ty muốn tìm một người "fit" với công việc, nghĩa là có thể đáp ứng được 80% công việc
2. Một điều thú vị là phỏng vấn thường sẽ khó hơn là khi thực hiện công việc, nên là đừng tạo áp lực quá lớn

- Glassdoor
- Chinese website for leak content

3. **Talk about people.** My Google manager always reminded me that he offered me a role because of my experience working with product managers and UX designers. Mention your experience working with cross-functional teammates.
4. **Talk about impact.** The impact is why that bullet matters. If you can clearly explain why the impact of your work matters, then it shows you can see the bigger picture that everything you do is for the end user.
5. Định lượng
6. **Experience > Completion.** It's 100% okay to put unfinished projects or work on your resume. It's more important that the candidate know the material and not whether it was actually done. Leading a project half way **STILL COUNTS** as leading a project.
