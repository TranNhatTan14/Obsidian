### Dedicated GPUs

CUDA is **a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs)**
The CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) platform is a software framework developed by NVIDIA to **expand the capabilities of GPU acceleration**
Whether for the host computer or the GPU device, **all CUDA source code is now processed according to C++ syntax rules**
**CUDA is specifically designed for Nvidia's GPUs** however, OpenCL works on Nvidia and AMD's GPUs. OpenCL's code can be run on both GPU and CPU whilst CUDA's code is only executed on GPU.
