### FAQ

**2. The Vingroup Scholarship Program requires applicants to apply to the top ranked fields/areas at the targeted universities. How can I check the rankings of the field/area at these universities?**

Applicants are required to apply to the top-ranked programs in the world at the targeted universities. We often refer to the¬†[Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings by Subject](https://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings/2021).

- **What is the process for selecting scholarship applicants?**
    
    The Selection Process consists of two rounds for Process/Track 1 applicants and three rounds for Process/Track 2 applicants:
    
    - Round 1:¬†Initial Application Screening. After the scholarship application deadline, the Scholarship Program will conduct an initial eligibility screening to ensure that the applications meet all the minimum, pre-determined requirements. After this initial screening, the Scholarship Selection Committee will review the applications and select the shortlisted candidates for the next round, the oral exam/interview.
    - Round 2:¬†Oral Exam/Interview. The Scholarship Selection Committee will conduct the Oral Exam/Interview Round, which will be in English and last up to 45 minutes for each candidate and will be conducted via teleconference or face-to-face, depending on the circumstances.
    - Round 3:¬†University Application Process. Applicants applying through Process/Track 2 will begin the process of applying to graduate degree programs in the supported fields at universities on the Targeted Universities list
- **How many times can applicants apply for the scholarship?**
    
    The Scholarship Program has no limit on the number of times an applicant may apply for a scholarship. An applicant, who has not been successful on the first application, may apply at the next intake.
