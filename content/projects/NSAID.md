**Alleles**
Different versions of the same variant are called alleles. For example, a SNP may have two alternative bases, or alleles, C and T4.
### Variant
Genetic variation is the difference in DNA sequences between individuals within a population

**VCF**
**VCF is the standard file format** for storing variation data. It is used by large scale variant mapping projects.

VCF is a preferred format because it is **unambiguous, scalable and flexible**, allowing extra information to be added to the info field. Many millions of variants can be stored in a single VCF file.

VCF files are tab delimited text files.

**Linkage Disequilibrium**
In the genome, alleles at variants close together on the same chromosome tend to occur together more often than is expected by chance. These blocks of alleles are called haplotypes. **Linkage disequilibrium** (LD) is a measure of how often two alleles or specific sequences are inherited together, with alleles that are always co-inherited said to be in linkage disequilibrium.
