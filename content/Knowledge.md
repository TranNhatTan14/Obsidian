### Machine Learning

### Computer Vision

###### Image Processing
###### Detection
###### Face detection
- Haar feature
- Intergral image
- Computing Integral Image using Raster Scanning
- Mask face detecion
- Emotion detection

###### Recognition
- The more difficult problem of category or class recognition was also initiallly
- General object recognition falls into two broad categories: instance recognition and class recognition
- Extracting infomative 2D features
- Feature-based approaches
- bag of words, bag of features, bag of keypoint
- compute the distribution (histogram) of visual words found in the query image and compares this distrubution to those found in the training images
- Old
- SIFT, k-means, naive Bayesian, SVM, boosting

###### Context and scene understanding

- Context play a very important role in human object recognition
- Providing usefull semantic clues for general scene understanding

###### Face recognition

- Human-Computer Interaction
- Face recognizers work best when they are given images of face under a wide variety of pose, illumination, and expression (PIE) conditions
- Research have also studied the automatic recognition of facial expressions
- Face detection techniques can be classified as feature-based, template-based, or appearance-based

###### Classification

- Emotion classification

- What if we choose the different basis vector
- Linear combination
- The span of v and w is the set of all their linear combinations
- Linearly independent 
- The basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space
