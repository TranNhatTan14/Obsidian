# To-do and Task

The difference between "to-do" and "task" lies in their usage and context:

- **To-do**: This refers to an item on a list of things that need to be done. It usually represents a reminder or pending action but doesn't specify when or how it should be done. A to-do can be something informal or part of personal organization.
- **Task**: This is more formal and refers to a specific piece of work or duty that needs to be completed, often within a certain timeframe. A task is often assigned in a professional or structured setting and usually involves a clear goal or deadline.

In short, a **to-do** is something you intend to do, while a **task** is more structured and goal-oriented.

# Summary

Summary like PCA, we can cover about 80% or less from data, get high concept of data

**Pros of Reading a Summary**

1. **Time-saving**: The summary is by its nature is made to save time and contains crisp information about the topic.
2. Helpful for Non-native readers: Every book is written in a language and sometimes the readers are non-native to that language. They make so many efforts to understand the topic but lose a lot due to incorrect translations, unawareness of the focus of the content. Reading summary enables the reader to cross-check their thought and understand the content in a better way.
3. **Helps in avoiding non-required content**: There are so many books in the world and even with multiple lives, one cannot read them. Having a summary enables the user to find out what the book covers and then if they are interested, they can read the entire book. It is like the test ride before actually buying the vehicle.
4. **Gives a second perspective**: Since the summary is written by someone, reading it gives a perspective to the reader. The reader can then read and contemplate if they wish to differ with the summary or they also find the essence to be similar.

**Cons of Reading Summary**

1. **Biased View**: The biggest loss in reading a summary is becoming biased. Sometimes the reader who is writing the summary is biased towards and against a topic that is covered in the book and thus ends up altering the content by mixing his own thoughts. As a result, the gist that you read is influenced and not an accurate representation of what is covered in the book. Readers can become biased themselves when reading the book because now they are carrying a thought with themselves about the book. Sometimes, they don’t even read the book until it is approved by someone else who they consider to be a trustworthy person.
2. **Missing the holistic picture**: The second biggest flaw of reading a summary is that one misses the holistic picture. A book is not about a concept or one separate idea. It is about the entirety of the concept, the coverage of various topics around the primary concept. The summary cannot be that detailed and starts from subtracting the non-essential elements. Here, the term “non-essential” is important. Because the term means different for everyone, for someone the example can be non-essential, for someone the theory can be non-essential, for someone the philosophy behind a thought can be non-essential. Everyone perceives the information differently and has a different way of absorbing the same information. There are high chances that the summary you are reading is missing a component that you would have favoured. It is the understanding of a different person and thus you are deprived of the knowledge you could have gained when you would have read and thought about the text yourself.
3. **Negligence to the research & Limitation to argument**s: When one drafts a book, they generally do a lot of research. The research along with the learnings, experiences, and knowledge is captured in form of a book. You cannot argue, decide, or question about these until you read them. A summary deprives you of it and thus basically eliminates the arguments that could have arisen because of sincere reading. This stalls the development of the topic. 

If I were to sum up, reading the summary is great if one doesn't have time or they just want to get the gist of the content. But for someone who wishes to read for knowledge and wisdom, reading the entire book is only right.
