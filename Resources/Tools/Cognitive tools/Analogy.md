# Input - Function - Output

### Kiến thức - Trải nghiệm - Kinh nghiệm

### Function = Tool > Blackbox = Deep Learning

### Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO)

- Technology: Mindset is akin to an operating system on a computer. It's the base program that determines how all other "applications" (thoughts, behaviors, decisions) run. Updating your mindset is like upgrading your OS for better performance.
- Cooking: Mindset is like the base ingredients in a recipe. The quality and type of these foundational elements significantly influence the final dish, just as our core beliefs shape our outcomes.

### Examples of Analogies:

1. **Analogy of the Brain and a Computer**:
    
    - **Brain**: Processes thoughts, stores memories, and controls bodily functions.
    - **Computer**: Processes data, stores information, and runs programs.
    - This analogy helps explain how the brain functions by comparing it to something familiar, like a computer.
2. **Electricity Flow and Water Flow**:
    - **Electricity**: Moves through wires, with voltage as the pressure pushing the current.
    - **Water**: Flows through pipes, with water pressure driving the flow.
    - This analogy clarifies how electricity works by comparing it to the flow of water in pipes.
3. **Heart as a Pump**:
    - **Heart**: Pumps blood throughout the body.
    - **Pump**: Moves liquid from one place to another.
    - This analogy makes it easier to understand how the heart circulates blood by comparing it to a mechanical pump.
4. **Learning a Skill Like Building Muscle**:
    
    - **Learning**: Requires practice and repetition to improve.
    - **Building Muscle**: Requires consistent exercise and effort to grow stronger.
    - This analogy explains how mastering a new skill is similar to developing physical strength over time.

These analogies clarify complex concepts by relating them to everyday objects or experiences.
