### Examples Use Cases

## Edge ML

Edge Machine Learning (Edge ML) runs machine learning algorithms directly on endpoint devices or closer to where the data is generated rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. This approach brings computation closer to the data source, reducing the need to send large volumes of data over networks, often resulting in lower latency and improved data privacy.
