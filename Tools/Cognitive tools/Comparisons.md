# To-do and Task

The difference between "to-do" and "task" lies in their usage and context:

- **To-do**: This refers to an item on a list of things that need to be done. It usually represents a reminder or pending action but doesn't specify when or how it should be done. A to-do can be something informal or part of personal organization.
- **Task**: This is more formal and refers to a specific piece of work or duty that needs to be completed, often within a certain timeframe. A task is often assigned in a professional or structured setting and usually involves a clear goal or deadline.

In short, a **to-do** is something you intend to do, while a **task** is more structured and goal-oriented.
