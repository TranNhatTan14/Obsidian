Use AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Variance) method to analyze genetic homogeneity with human STR or mtDNA data. Display the genetic homogeneity results in a table format.

Use the AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Variance) method to assess the genetic variation within and between populations to determine their genetic homogeneity using STR or mtDNA data

- AMOVA is a method used to understand how genetics differences vary with and between groups.
- Imagine dividing peole into groups and seeing if they're genetically similar.
- AMOVA helps us check if the variation in genes is mostly within the same group or spead across different groups.
- AMOVA partitions molecular variance into components attributable to hierarchical population structures, using a distance matrix calculated from genetic data.
- It is especially usefull when working with genetics data across geographically or genetically defined population

Requires genetic data that can be used to calculate genetic distances between individuals or groups

1. Molecular Marker Data

- STR: Highly variable sequences that provide detailed information on genetics differences
- SNP
- mtDNA: Often used in studies of material lineage and population structure
