# Data

### Data Preprocessing

Cleaning and normalizing data to ensure AI models are trained on high-quality datasets

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data is the lifeblood of AI. You must be adept at data preprocessing, which includes cleaning and normalizing data to ensure that your AI models are trained on high-quality datasets. 

### Data Manipulation

Acquire skills in using tools that facilitate efficient data manipulation.

### Database Management Systems

 Understand the workings and management of database systems to support robust AI solutions.

Learning to use data manipulation tools and understanding database management systems are also valuable skills. 

By mastering data handling, you'll ensure that your AI solutions are built on solid ground, leading to more accurate outcomes.

Learn to use tools like SQL, pandas, and Hadoop for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

 Stay abreast of emerging ML trends and frameworks, and practice by building and refining your own models.
