Mindfulness is a state of activate, open [[attention]] on the present. When you're mindful, you observe your thoughts and feelings from a distance, without judging them good or bad.
Mindfulness is a quality or practice of maintaining awareness of the present moment without judgement.
Like paying [[attention]] to your breathing or the food you're eating.

Instead of letting your [[life]] pass you, mindfulness means living in the moment, and awakening to experience.
It can be practiced anytime throughout the day, whether you're walking, eating, or working.
It can be incorporated into daily activities.
