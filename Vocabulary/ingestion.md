In artificial intelligence (AI), "data ingestion" refers to the process of collecting, importing, and preparing data from various sources for further analysis or training models. It involves gathering raw data (e.g., from databases, APIs, files), cleaning it, transforming it into a suitable format, and loading it into a system where it can be used for tasks like training machine learning models or running AI algorithms. Data ingestion is critical for ensuring that the AI system has high-quality, relevant data to work with.
