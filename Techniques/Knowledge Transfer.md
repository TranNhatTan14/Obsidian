Knowledge transfer involves using skills, [[knowledge]], or strategies learned in one context and applying them to another, either related or novel. It can be positive (when prior learning helps in new situations) or negative (when it interferes with learning new skills). Successful knowledge transfer depends on recognizing underlying similarities between contexts, which is why teaching general principles or abstract concepts enhances transfer. This concept is significant in education and workplace training, as it enables learners to adapt and apply their expertise across various [[tasks]] and fields, promoting innovation and problem-solving.
