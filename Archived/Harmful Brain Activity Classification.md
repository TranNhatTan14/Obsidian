1. What is spectrograms
What is spectrogram in EEG?

The central tool in quantitative EEG, the ‚Äúspectrogram,‚Äù also known as¬†**color spectral array or color density spectral array**, is standard in most quantitative EEG software. The spectrogram is typically displayed as a three-way plot of time on the x axis, frequency on the y axis, and power as color.

A spectrogram is a visual way of¬†**representing the signal strength, or ‚Äúloudness‚Äù, of a signal over time at various frequencies present in a particular waveform**. Not only can one see whether there is more or less energy at, for example, 2 Hz vs 10 Hz, but one can also see how energy levels vary over time.

Spectrogram is of advantage to¬†**express speech signal than other features in time-domain or frequency-domain alone**, combining the merit of both domains and showing the relationship of time, frequency, and amplitude directly.

In the datasets used in previous works, in the stage of the extraction of the fingerprint of each audio file, constant spectrogram parameters (**window length, overlap, FFT number**) are used in general while these files are recorded in the dataset.

one example how to do it is to download and save the pip-wheel of torch geometric and create a dataset with it. Then in the submission kernel put this dataset as input and pip install from that wheel

- [Do spectrograms contain more "information" than signals?](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification/discussion/478391)
    
- Spectrograms with more than one EEG ID
    
    In train.csv, there are 2380 spectrogram ids that have more than one eeg id associated with them.
    
    What does that mean?
    
    I thought each spectrogram is a 10 minute window over a single eeg centered at the same time.
    
    There are 1950 unique patients. Each patient can have hours of readings. Kaggle split the EEG into 17089 files and the spectrograms into 11138 files. Alternatively, we could have had just 1950 EEG files and 1950 spectrogram files but they would have been too large files.
    

### Features

- Feature engineering
    
    - In the medical field, interpretability of the solution is key to understand what the model is doing
        
    - Hand-made interpretable feature engineering on raw EEG epochs with a classification machine learning model
        
        - Statistics on raw epochs of EEG signal (tme features)
        - Frequency features
        - Time-frequency features based on coefficients of the wavelet transform
        - Hjorth parameters:¬†[Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjorth_parameters)
            
            The Hjorth parameters look really useful. The PDs and RDAs require a semi-constant frequency, so I imagine the Hjorth complexity would be useful here
            
        - Power Spectral density, Entropy features
        - Features from EEG waves: delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma
            
    - Deep Learning approach as the deep model can learn informative features directly from the raw EEG signnals
    - CNN model for the best features learning approach
