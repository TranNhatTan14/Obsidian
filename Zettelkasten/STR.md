Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable segment 1 (HV1) is a sequence polymorphism that's used in many applications, including: Forensic genetics, Genetic diversity and human evolution assessment, Consanguinity determination, and Mitochondrial disease diagnosis.

HV1 is part of the control region of mtDNA, which is the most polymorphic region of the molecule. The control region contains three hypervariable regions (HV1, HV2, and HV3).

Here are some examples of studies that use HV1:

Vietnamese population

A study of 517 unrelated Vietnamese individuals found 50 haplogroups, with the most common being F1a (15.7%), B5a (10.8%), M (8.9%), and M7b1 (7.7%). The study also estimated genetic diversity at 99.83% and the probability of a random match at 0.37%
