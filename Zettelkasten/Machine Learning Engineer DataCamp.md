This career track teaches you everything you need to know about machine learning engineering and MLOps.

# MLOps Concepts

Discover how MLOps can take machine learning models from local notebooks to functioning models in production that generate real business value.

# End-to-end Machine Learning

Dive into the world of machine learning and discover how to design, train, and deploy end-to-end models.

# Developing ML Models for Production

# Shell

# MLflow

Learn how to use MLflow to simplify the complexities of building machine learning applications. Explore MLflow tracking, projects, models, and model registry.

# Fully Automated MLOps

Learn about MLOps architecture, CI/CD/CM/CT techniques, and automation patterns to deploy ML systems that can deliver value over time.

# ETL and ELT in Python

Learn to build effective, performant, and reliable data pipelines using Extract, Transform, and Load principles.

# CI/CD for Machine Learning

Elevate your Machine Learning Development with CI/CD using GitHub Actions and Data Version Control

The course will empower you to streamline your machine learning development processes, enhancing efficiency, reliability, and reproducibility in your projects. Throughout the course, you'll develop a comprehensive understanding of CI/CD workflows and YAML syntax, utilizing GitHub Actions (GA) for automation, training models in a pipeline, versioning datasets with DVC, and performing hyperparameter tuning.

You'll be introduced to the fundamental concepts of CI/CD and YAML, and gain an understanding of the software development life cycle and key terms like build, test, and deploy. You'll define Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment while examining their distinctions. You'll also explore the utility of CI/CD in machine learning and experimentation.

You'll learn about GA, a powerful platform for implementing CI/CD workflows. You'll discover the various elements of GA, including events, actions, jobs, steps, runners, and context. You'll learn how to define workflows triggered by events such as push and pull requests and customize runner machines. You'll also gain practical experience by setting up basic CI pipelines and understanding the GA log.

You'll delve deep into Data Version Control (DVC) for versioning datasets, initializing DVC, and tracking datasets. Using DVC pipelines, you'll learn how to train classification models and generate metrics in a reproducible manner.

You'll then ==focus on model performance analysis and hyperparameter tuning== and gain practical skills in comparing metrics and plots across branches to track changes in model performance. You'll learn how to ==perform hyperparameter tuning using scikit-learn's GridSearchCV==. Additionally, you'll explore automating pull requests with the best model configuration.

### Introduction to Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery and YAML

In this chapter, you will explore the essential principles of Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and YAML. You'll grasp the software development life cycle and key terms like build, test, and deploy. Discover the differences between Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment. Moreover, you'll investigate the significance of CI/CD in machine learning and experimentation.

# Deployment and Life Cycling

# Monitoring and Maintenance
