- The genome of an organism is made up of a unique DNA or RNA sequence
- Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) determines the order of all, or most, of the nucleotides in the genome
- The information encoded in the genomes of bacteria, viruses, and fungi provide researchers with unique genetic "fingerprints."
