### Reflection:

- **Layperson Explanation**: Reflection is when you look back on past experiences, thoughts, or actions to understand them better and learn from them. Itâ€™s like reviewing what happened to improve for the future.
- **Beginner Level**: Reflection involves analyzing your own behaviors, decisions, or feelings to gain insight. For example, after completing a project, you reflect on what went well and what could be improved.
- **Advanced Insight**: Reflection is a metacognitive process that fosters self-awareness, critical thinking, and personal growth. It can be formal (structured journaling) or informal (mental review), and it is used in fields like education, psychology, and professional development to enhance learning and adaptive practices.

### Intentions:
- **Layperson Explanation**: Intentions are the plans or goals you set for yourself about what you want to do or achieve. They guide your actions and decisions.
- **Beginner Level**: Intentions are like mental commitments to perform certain actions. For example, intending to exercise daily means you aim to prioritize fitness in your routine.
- **Advanced Insight**: Intentions are cognitive representations of a desired outcome or action. They are goal-directed and shaped by motivation, values, and environmental factors. In psychology, intentions are central to behavior change models like the Theory of Planned Behavior, which links intention strength to actual behavioral execution.
