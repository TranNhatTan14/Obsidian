# Definition

An intention is idea that you plan (or intend) to carry out. If you mean something, it's an intention. Your goal, purpose, or aim is your intention. It's something you mean to do, whether you pull it off or not.

- **Layperson Explanation**: Intentions are the plans or goals you set for yourself about what you want to do or achieve. They guide your actions and decisions.
- **Beginner Level**: Intentions are like mental commitments to perform certain actions. For example, intending to exercise daily means you aim to prioritize fitness in your routine.
- **Advanced Insight**: Intentions are cognitive representations of a desired outcome or action. They are goal-directed and shaped by motivation, values, and environmental factors. In psychology, intentions are central to behavior change models like the Theory of Planned Behavior, which links intention strength to actual behavioral execution.
