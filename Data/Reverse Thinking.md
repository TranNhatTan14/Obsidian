Reverse thinking or inversion is a powerful lateral thinking technique that can help you generate novel solutions or avoid potential pitfalls. It involves **imagining the opposite of what you want to achieve or what you expect to happen, and then working backwards to identify the causes, consequences, and alternatives**

Reverse thinking is **a brainstorming technique that challenges our thinking on how to approach a problem**. Instead of coming up with ideas of how to solve a problem, solve by identifying how to cause the problem.

- In problem-solving, think about what would cause the issue rather than what would solve it.
