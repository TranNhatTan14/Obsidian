- **Understanding Insulin and Fat Storage**: The author explains that understanding insulin's mechanism and its role in storing excess fat inspired them to exercise daily for at least 30 minutes in the morning before breakfast for the past two years.

- **Role of Glycogen Storage**:  
  - Liver stores ~400 kcal of glycogen; muscles store ~1600 kcal.  
  - Overnight, the liver uses ~65% of its glycogen (~260 kcal) to supply glucose to the brain, but muscle glycogen remains mostly unused.

- **Impact of Morning Meals**:  
  - Consuming carbohydrate-rich foods (e.g., 200-300g of sticky rice) in the morning rapidly increases glucose levels.  
  - Excess glucose gets stored as glycogen, and once glycogen stores are full, insulin converts glucose into fat.

- **Exercise Benefits**:  
  - Morning exercise helps burn muscle glycogen and increases the capacity to refill glycogen stores in both liver and muscles after eating.  
  - This process reduces the likelihood of glucose being stored as fat.

- **Exercise Recommendations**:  
  - Moderate activities like walking or playing badminton suffice; high-intensity or weightlifting is not mandatory.  
  - Consistent small changes lead to long-term benefits.

- **Further Resources**:  
  - The author suggests looking into PubMed for glycogen and fat accumulation studies.  
  - They recommend *Physiology & Anatomy* textbooks or materials from Utrecht University's nutrition program (*Leerboek Voeding*).

- **Future Topics**:  
  - Upcoming posts will delve deeper into insulin, fat storage, and type 2 diabetes.
