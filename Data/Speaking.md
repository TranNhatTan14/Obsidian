# Speaking Strategies

# Alliteration

Alliteration involves the repetition of sounds across a phase or group of words. This adds lyricism to your language, but it also makes your phases more vivid and easier for audience to grasp

# Amplification

Amplification occurs when a speaker arranges words or ideas in the order of increasing force or importance. Often this involves using a list or repeating key terms while building to a climax. Powerful speakers frequently use amplification to create an emotional response in their audiences.

# [[Analogy]]

Analogies compare two things using "like" or "as". They are often used to provide a simple explaination for a more complicated idea.
Additionally, they can be used to deliver a vivid image for an audience that fully captures their imaginations. A well-timed analogy can add depth to your speech as it helps your audience understand your central points.

# Anamnesis

Anamnesis refers to a recollection of the past. While appeeals to history can sometimes involve logical fallacies, they can also be used effectively to emphasize commonalities between speaker and audience and demonstrate a speaker's mastery of subject. In this way. anamnesis forms a part of a larger appeal to ethos, or the character and authority of a speaker.

# Anaphora

Anaphora occurs when the same word or phrase begins sentences or clauses that appear close to one another. It adds emphasis to the repeated idea and also creates a pleasing rhythmic effect. Often used at the beginnings and endings of speeches, anaphora makes a speech more powerful and memorable.

# Antithesis

Antithesis occurs when two ideas are placed in opposition to one another. It uses a parallel structure to create contrast. Because ideas are often easier to grasp when we understand their opposites, antithesis is a useful rhetorical device for conveying arguments so they are approachable and easy to remember. 

# Appeal to Ethos

Derived from ancient Greek, ethos means character. In rhetoric, an appeal to ethos is an appeal to the authority and trustworthiness of a speaker. Ethos can be established prior to a speech by a speaker's reputation, or it can be established by demonstrating knowledge about a subject. An audience needs to trust and respect a speaker if a speech is to be effective, and appeals to ethos are the central means of accomplishing this.

# Appeal to Pathos

Derived from ancient Greek, pathos means "experience" or "suffering." In rhetoric, an appeal to pathos is an appeal to an audience's emotions and imaginations. The aim of an appeal to pathos is to help the audience understand and share in the speaker's own viewpoint. Appeals to pathos work best when they emphasize a shared value between the speaker and the audience and when paired with logical arguments.

# Asyndeton

Asyndeton is the intentional omission of a conjunction, such as leaving out "and" from a list. Leaving out these conjunctions while maintaining the usual grammatical form of the sentence can result in a sentence that feels more immediate and dramatic. It is a powerful tool to add emphasis at crucial points of a speech. 

# Humor

Effective speakers use humor in a variety of ways: to keep an audience engaged, to appear more personable, or to make an unpopular idea more acceptable. If used inappropriately or too frequently, humor can be damaging to a speech. However, when used sparingly and at the right moments, humor makes speeches significantly more memorable.

# Inclusive language

Speakers can develop a good rapport with an audience by using inclusive language such as "we" and "our." Inclusive language shows that the speaker identifies with the audience members and has their interests in mind, and this in turn makes the speaker appear more trustworthy to the audience.

# Metaphor

Metaphors occur when a word or phrase is applied to something to which it does not literally apply. They suggest a rich and often engaging comparison between two things, and they can be short and focused or long and complex. Metaphors can create a strong emotional response in an audience. They can also make a difficult idea or argument easier to comprehend. 

# Parallelism

Parallelism occurs when a speaker uses a similar grammatical structure within a sentence or across multiple sentences. By repeating a central element, parallelism adds clarity to a speech and makes it easier for the audience to grasp a central idea. However, it can also add rhythm to a speech, making it more powerful and memorable.

# Repetition

Repetition in speeches is important because your audience can't pause or return to what you have said. You should state your ideas clearly and return to them often. However, repetition can also be used to highlight specific words and ideas in particular parts of your speech. Doing so can add rhythm to your language as it emphasizes a single idea. 

# Rule of Three 

The rule of three is one of the most common and powerful devices used by speakers. It is easy for an audience to grasp and remember items that appear in groups of three, often to dramatic effect. Use the rule of three to make sure you focus on your most important points and to avoid overwhelming an audience with superfluous information.
