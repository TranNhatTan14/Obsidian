# Definition

- A knowledge graph is a way of organizing information as a network of interconnected entities and their relationships. Imagine a web where each dot represents a piece of information like person, place, or even an abstract concept, and lines between them describe how they are related. That's the essence of knowledge graph.
- Knowledge graphs go beyond just storing data, they capture the meaning and context of information, making it easier to understand and use.
- This structure allows for powerful queries and analysis.

# Why it matters

- Knowledge graphs power many of the applications, we use daily, like Google Search.

- Building a personal knowledge graph is like creating your own interconnected web of notes, ideas, and resources. Instead of just passively consuming information, you actively  link it together to deepen your understanding and make it easier to recall and apply.
- Remember, the best PKG is the one you'll actually use. Don't worry about making it perfect from start. Focus on capturing your thoughts and connections, then refine it as you go. The process of building your PKG is as valuable as the end result.
