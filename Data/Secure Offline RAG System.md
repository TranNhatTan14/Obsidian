# Introduction

While we leverage powerful models like GPT-4 and OpenAI embeddings, some use cases require a fully offline solution to ensure data sensitivity and compliance.

We invite the data science community on Trustii.io to help us create a complete offline RAG system for embeddings creation and chat/retrieval, leveraging the power of open-source technologies. 
# Objectives

**Build a Flexible Local RAG System**:
- Develop a RAG system that generates embeddings using an open-source LLM, the system must support local execution without relying on external API calls.
- The system should be **flexible** and capable of handling various types of text data, including but not limited to Q&A datasets, websites, code snippets, documentation, and more.

**Create a Versatile Local Chat Interface**
- Build a chat interface that interacts with the vector store generated from text embeddings and stored locally.
- This interface should allow users to query embeddings and retrieve relevant information to generate responses through locally executed LLM.
- The interface should support interaction with different content types, multiple languages specifically handling queries in **English and French,** code snippets, etc demonstrating the system's flexibility.

## Technical Requirements :

**Local Execution**: The RAG system must run entirely locally without making external API calls to LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4). Use open-source models for generating embeddings and text retrieval like LLAMA.

**Vector Store Implementation**:Use a vector database (must be **Faiss**) to build a vector store for efficient text retrieval. Generate embeddings using open-source LLMs (such as **LLaMA**, **Sentence Transformers**, **Mistral**) to create vectors stored in the vector store.

**Use of LangChain**: Build a chat interface using the **LangChain API**, allowing users to interact with the vector store and generate responses based on retrieved documents. The interface should demonstrate flexibility by handling various content types (text, code, websites, etc.). The chat interface must Support multiple languages, specifically English and French, for both text retrieval and response generation. The LLM must be capable of processing and generating **code snippets** and technical language.

# 1. Project Setup and Environment Preparation

1. Create a new Python project directory
2. Set up a virtual environment
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain faiss-cpu sentence-transformers torch transformers datasets pandas numpy
   ```

# 2. Data Processing and Preparation

1. Load and examine the training data:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
   test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
   ```
2. Preprocess the text data:
   - Clean text
   - Handle multiple languages (English/French)
   - Separate code snippets from regular text
   - Create document chunks for embedding

# 3. Embedding System Implementation

1. Choose and implement the embedding model:
   - Use Sentence Transformers for initial embeddings
   - Consider multilingual models like 'paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2'
2. Set up FAISS vector store:
   - Create index structure
   - Generate embeddings for training data
   - Store embeddings in FAISS

# 4. RAG System Development

1. Set up local LLM:
   - Download and configure Mistral or LLaMA model
   - Implement model loading and inference
2. Create RAG pipeline:
   - Document retrieval system
   - Context preparation
   - Response generation
3. Implement language detection and handling:
   - Detect query language
   - Route to appropriate model/prompt

# 5. LangChain Integration
1. Set up LangChain components:
   ```python
   from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
   from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
   from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
   from langchain.llms import HuggingFacePipeline
   ```
2. Create retrieval chain:
   - Configure embeddings
   - Set up vector store
   - Create QA chain

# 6. Chat Interface Development

1. Build basic chat interface:
   - Query input handling
   - Response formatting
   - Language switching
2. Implement specialized handlers:
   - Code snippet detection and formatting
   - Technical documentation handling
   - Language-specific response generation

# 7. Testing and Validation

1. Test system components:
   - Embedding generation
   - Retrieval accuracy
   - Response quality
2. Validate multilingual support:
   - English queries
   - French queries
   - Code-related queries

# 8. Response Generation Pipeline

1. Create prediction pipeline:
   ```python
   def generate_responses(test_df, rag_chain):
       responses = []
       for query in test_df['Query']:
           response = rag_chain.run(query)
           responses.append(response)
       return responses
   ```
2. Generate test set predictions
3. Format output CSV

Let's start with implementing the first major component - would you like me to create the code for the embedding system or the RAG pipeline first?

This implementation will ensure:
- Fully offline operation
- Multilingual support (English/French)
- Code snippet handling
- FAISS vector store integration
- LangChain-based architecture
- Local LLM usage
