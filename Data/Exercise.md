**Supersets and Circuits:** To maximize your time, superset exercises that target different muscle groups[3]. For example, pair a chest exercise with a triceps exercise during your push day.

**Progression:** Aim to increase the weight, reps, or sets each week to ensure progressive overload[1]. If you can perform more reps than the prescribed range with good form, increase the weight.

**Recovery and Nutrition:** Prioritize sleep to allow for muscle recovery. Consume a protein-rich meal or shake after your workout to aid muscle repair and growth. Consider a small pre-workout snack with carbs and protein for energy.
