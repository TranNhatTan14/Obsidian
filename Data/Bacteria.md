- Bacteria are single-celled organisms that are found everywhere on Earth, from the soil to the air to inside our bodies.
- They are prokaryotes,  which means they do not have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles

Plasmid

- Plasmids are small, circular pieces of DNA that are separate from the main bacterial chromosome.
- They can replicate independently and often carry genes that provide bacteria with advantages, such as antibiotic resistance.

- Key features of Plasmids
	- Circular DNA
	- Independent Replication
	- Gene Carriers
		- Plasmids often carry genes that give bacteria beneficial traits, like antibiotic

- Think of plasmids like extra tools for bacteria, giving them special abilities to survive and thrive in different environments.
- For example, a plasmid might contain a gene that allows a bacterium to break down a specific type of sugar for enegy, or a gene that makes it resistant to a particular antibiotic.

Can plasmids be transferred between different bacterial species

- Plasmid can be transferred between different bacterial species, and this ability play a crucial role in the spread of antibiotic resistance and other genetics traits. The primary mechanism of this transfer is called conjugation.

- During conjugation, a bacterium carrying a plasmid (the donor) forms a physical connection with another bacterium (the recipient) through a structure called a pilus. The plasmid is then replicated and transferred through the pilus to the recipient bacterium. This process allows for the direct transfer of genetic material between bacteria, even if they belong to different species.
