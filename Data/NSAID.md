	- Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim to identify associations of genotypes with phenotypes by testing for differences in the allele frequency of genetic variants between individuals who are ancestrally similar but differ phenotypicall
	- GWAS can consider copy-number variants or sequence variations in the human genome, although the most commonly studied genetic variants in GWAS are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
