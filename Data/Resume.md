# Advice

3. **Talk about people.** My Google manager always reminded me that he offered me a role ==because of my experience working with product managers and UX designers. Mention your experience working with cross-functional teammates.==
4. **Talk about impact.** The impact is why that bullet matters. If you can clearly explain why the impact of your work matters, then it shows you can see the bigger picture that everything you do is for the end user.
5. Định lượng
6. **Experience > Completion.** It's 100% okay to put unfinished projects or work on your resume. It's more important that the candidate know the material and not whether it was actually done. Leading a project half way **STILL COUNTS** as leading a project.

- You have ==previous experience in a fast-paced startup environment==
- You have ==excellent written and verbal communication skills==
