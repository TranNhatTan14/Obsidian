# Advice

3. **Talk about people.** My Google manager always reminded me that he offered me a role ==because of my experience working with product managers and UX designers. Mention your experience working with cross-functional teammates.==
4. **Talk about impact.** The impact is why that bullet matters. If you can clearly explain why the impact of your work matters, then it shows you can see the bigger picture that everything you do is for the end user.
5. Định lượng
6. **Experience > Completion.** It's 100% okay to put unfinished projects or work on your resume. It's more important that the candidate know the material and not whether it was actually done. Leading a project half way **STILL COUNTS** as leading a project.

- You have ==previous experience in a fast-paced startup environment==
- You have ==excellent written and verbal communication skills==

Research on emotion classification using EEG signals
1. Emotion classification using EEG signals
2. Health data: heart rate, calories, distance, steps, ...

Frenz Brainband: EEG, EOG, EMG

- Dữ liệu được xử lý như thế nào
- Time-frequency analysis
- segmenting the EEG signal into short overlaping time windows and applying FFT to each window
- Power Spectrail Density
- Spectral entropy
- Mean
- Variance
- STD

**Feature Extraction**
EEG signal is divided into a sequence of windows of length one second, with consecutive windows overlapping by 0.5 s
Features: mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, maximum, minimum, magnitude of the frequency component of each signal, obtained using a FFT

**Proposed and developed an emotion classification algorithm based on brainwave signals**
