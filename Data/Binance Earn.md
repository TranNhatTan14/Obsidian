### Dual Investment

Buy Low, Sell High, Earn More

Overview

Dual Investment is a high-yield structured financial product that allows you an opportunity to buy low or sell high cryptocurrency at your desired price and date in the future, while earning rewards no matter which direction the market goes.

There are two types of Dual Investment products: “Buy Low” and “Sell High”.

Risk

Dual Investment, while versatile and potentially profitable, requires an understanding of the risks involved:

- Market Price Volatility Risk
	- The market could move in an unforeseen direction, leading to missed opportunities. If the price moves further away from the Target Price, you end up losing the opportunity to buy or sell at a more favorable price.
- Less Flexibility
	- Once subscribed, your funds will be locked up and you won’t be able to access your funds until the Settlement Date.

Benefit

- Buy Low or Sell High
	- You can buy crypto at a lower price or sell crypto at a higher price.
- Wide Selection
	- You can choose from a wide variety of assets and set the target date and price to your liking.
- High Rewards
	- You’ll earn a high passive income no matter which direction the market goes.
- No Trading Fees
	- Zero trading fees when the target is reached and the “Buy Low” or “Sell High” product is filled.

Source of Yield

The yield on Dual Investment is dependent on Market Volatility, Fixing Price, and Settlement Date. It varies between different instruments. You should consider whether this is important to you before subscribing.
