### Start with the suggested questions

Once you’ve added content to NotebookLM, it’s time to start asking questions — which might leave you stumped. Similarly to tips we shared about using the Gemini-powered side panel in Workspace tools, Steven says NotebookLM’s suggested questions are a great resource. “The model will actually help you ask questions that guide you through the material for a while until you think of something you want to ask,” he explains. You can find some starter questions in the "Notebook Guide" that appears after you upload your first sources. Plus, when you start asking questions, NotebookLM will suggest follow-up queries, too, based on what you’ve already asked and what you uploaded.

### Summarization

- AI-Powered Summarization: Generates concise summaries of lengthy documents for quick understanding.  

### ==Connect the dots from diffrent materials==

NotebookLM is extremely useful for situations where you need to manage, connect and synthesize information from multiple sources. “We all have this problem where we’re working on something, and the information we need is scattered across desktop folders, tabs and wherever else,” Steven says. This is what NotebookLM is made for, he explains: connecting all those scattered dots.

It can be especially helpful as a next step after using Gemini and Gems. After you brainstorm or have other open-ended conversations in those tools, NotebookLM can take the results and turn them into something easy to follow. Steven offers the example of working on a slide deck. Maybe you start the process by brainstorming with Gemini, which leads you to open a few tabs of articles, save some design inspo images and put some notes in a Google doc. You can then feed all of that into NotebookLM, which will synthesize the information into an easy-to-digest format so you can reference everything in one place when you get to the stage of building your presentation in Google Slides.
