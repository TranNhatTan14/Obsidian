1. Xác định được chính xác plasmid contig từ assembly chỉ từ short-read thay vì long-read
2. Tái cấu trúc lại được plasmid

# Abstract

- Most of the task treat contig as independent
- Classification of a contig can be improved from the knowledge of the neighboring node from alignment in the assembly graph
- Use unitig instead of contig to reduce error

# Introduction

There are two major challenges for plasmid identification

- Plasmids exhibit high genetic diversity
- The shared genes or segments between plasmids and chromosomes
- Vấn đề đang gặp phải là số lượng mẫu có thể alignment được với database không nhiều

# Related Work

- Thông tin từ những plasmid đã tìm được (database), những thông tin liên quan đến plasmid và chromosome
- Contig có những đoạn rất ngắn, không liên kết với các contig khác, và không xác định được các giá trị vật lý
- Đoạn chứa thông tin có thể bị cắt ngắn ra làm không xác định được protein, hoặc là có lỗi trong quá trình assembly
- Hiện tại gặp khó khăn đối với các contig ngắn dưới 1000 kb

Alignment-based tools

- Based on the similarities between queries and reference
- For database we can use vector database to query faster. But we need a way to tokenize the query sequence
    
Learning-based tools

- provide a promising alternative for detecting more diverged plasmids via learning abstract patterns beyond sequence similarity.
- Use k-mer freq as the features and applied sequential minimal optimization, fully connected neural network
- PPR-Meta encodes the sequences and the contained codons into one-hot matrices and then trains a CNN model for prediction
- Decreased precision on short contigs, whose length limits the capacity of feature learning
- Can have ambiguous predictions for contigs from shared regions between plasmids and chromosomes

Hybrid
    
- In order to achieve an optimal trade-off between sensitivity and precision, combine homology search and machine learning to identify as many as possible
- PlasmidVerify train a Naive Bayes classifier using protein domain alighment-based feature
- PlasForest using homology search results as features
- Also exhibit decreased accuracy on short contigs
- PLASMe: treat plasmid as a language defined on a vocabulary of protein. Transformer, to learn the protein importantce and their associations for plasmid
- Plasmids have a large diversity, novel plasmids may contain proteins that cannot be aligned with the current database, leading to inaccurate predictions
- The current tokens contain only proteins of plasmids. Studies have shown that proteins critical for bacterial survival are more likely to be found in chromosomes
- The interpretation of the Transformer identified potentially unannotated PCs that may also play an important role in the life of plasmids

# Method

- The data for testing

## Input data

- ==Illumina paired-end short reads sequencing==
	- Download from SRA
	- Download complete genome from NCBI
	- From 3 bacteria species
		- E. Coli
		- K. p
		- S. a
## Data preparaion

1. **Input Data**:
   - Download Illumina paired-end short-read sequencing data from SRA (Sequence Read Archive).
   - Download complete genomes of target bacteria (e.g., *E. coli*, *K. pneumoniae*, *S. aureus*) from NCBI.
   
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Perform **assembly** using **metaSPAdes** to generate **unitig assembly graphs**.
   - Extract **contigs** and **unitigs** from the assembly graph.
   
1. **Ground Truth**:
   - Use known plasmid sequences from databases like **PlasmidDB** or **PLSDB**.
   - For novel plasmids, use tools like **PlasmidEC** or **gplas2** to infer plasmid sequences.

- How will you define ground truth for training [[PlasmidEC and gplas2]]
	- Will you use known plasmid sequences from databases like PlasmidDB
	- How will you handle novel plasmid (it mean we can't align to database)
- What specific plasmid characteristics are you planning to leverage
	- Circular nature of plasmids
	- Presence of plasmid-specific genes (rep genes, mob genes)
	- Size distributions

## Quality Control

1. Filter by length < 100 bp
2. Alignment with chromosome database to exclude high predict chromosome, markers, ... to get information about gene (both plasmid and chromosome)
4. Extract information from assembly graph
5. Create unitig or assembly graph file

Kết hợp theo 3 hướng

- Alignment
- Graph sử dụng thông tin từ asssembly graph
- Transformer sử dụng token liên quan đến protein đặc trưng cho plasmid và chromosome. Transfer Learning from [[Natural Language Processing]]

##  Alignment approach

- Align contigs to known plasmid databases (e.g., PLSDB, plasmidFinder) and ==chromosome database==
- Extract features from alignment results:
    - Percentage of contig aligned
    - Number of hits
    - E-values of hits
    - Coverage of known plasmid genes

- You can also reverse the process, and map your de novo assembly against a reference genome, only containing chromosomal DNA. 
	- Then look at the pieces that don't match, if you get a large (or several) contigs that don't map, have a higher coverage and different GC content, you could be looking at a (or several) plasmid (s). 
	- You can then blast the sequence(s) to see if you find a hit.

## Graph approach

- Mapping the known plasmids of your organism against the de novo assembly. 
	- Plasmid DNA has a higher coverage and different GC content compared to your chromosomal DNA, so this is also a key point that you can look at.
	- So if you get a contig that shows a high similarity to a known plasmid, has a higher coverage and a different GC content than the majority of contigs, you can be quite sure you are looking at a plasmid.
- Relative features
- Additional information encoded in the longer sequences
- Codon usage patterns

### Node features

- Coverage depth
- Sequencing composition
	- GC content [[plASgraph2]] for relative idea
	- k-mer frequencies [[UnitigBIN]]
	- Length of contigs
	- Node connectivity patterns
    
- ==Degree==: The number of edges connected to a node. It helps quantify the importance or centrality of a node in the network.
- **Node Centrality**: Metrics like betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, or eigenvector centrality to quantify the importance of a node within the graph.
- ==Node Embeddings==: Representations learned from node neighborhoods (e.g., using methods like Node2Vec or Graph Neural Networks) to capture node similarities in low-dimensional space.
- K-mer composition
    
### Edge Features
    
- **Edge Weight**: In weighted graphs, edge weights signify the strength of connections between nodes.
- **Edge Betweenness**: Quantifies the number of shortest paths passing through an edge, helping identify bottleneck connections.
- ==Edge Type==: In heterogeneous graphs, edges can represent different types of relationships (e.g., friend vs. colleague in a social network). ==Positive or negative relation==
- Confident of edge like length of the overlap
    
### Graph-Level Features
    
- **Graph Density**: Ratio of the number of edges to the number of possible edges, describing how interconnected the graph is.
- **Graph Diameter**: The longest shortest path between any two nodes, indicating the "spread" of the graph.
- **Average Path Length**: The average distance between pairs of nodes, useful for understanding the graph's compactness.
- **Graph Laplacian**: A matrix representation capturing node connectivity that is useful in spectral graph analysis.

- hai contig noi voi nhau va can kiem tra thong tin lien quan den coverage because of randon fragmentrtion
- One key feature of plasmids is that many are circular. In an assembly graph, if you observe that certain contigs form a **small circular structure**, that’s a strong indication of a plasmid. Tools that detect circularity, such as SPAdes or Unicycler, can identify these loops in the graph and suggest plasmid contigs.

## Binning

## Classification

## Modeling

## Ensemble Approach

- Combine predictions from Transformer and Graph models
## Post-processing

- Filtering: Remove contigs with low prediction scores
- Clustering: Group contigs predicted as plasmids based on their connectivity in the assembly graph and other feature (coverage similarity)
- Validation
- Manual curation of high-confidence predictions
- Experimental validation of novel plasmid predictions

# Evaluation and Validation

- What metrics you use to evaluate performance?
	- Precision/Recall for plasmid identification
	- Accuracy of plasmid boundary determination
	- Robustness to different assembly qualities
- How will you compare your method to existing tools
	- PlasmidSPAdes
	- PlasFlow
	- Other machine learning-based approaches

# Q&A

### Differences between Plasmids and Chromosomes

Plasmids

- Typically **small**, circular pieces of DNA.
- Often carry genes that provide **adaptive advantages**, such as antibiotic resistance or toxin production.
- Replicate independently of the host’s chromosomal DNA.
- Found in bacteria and sometimes in eukaryotes.
- Contain fewer genes compared to chromosomes, often coding for **non-essential** functions.

Chromosomes

- **Larger** in size, usually linear in eukaryotes (but circular in prokaryotes).
- Contain **essential genes** required for cell growth, division, and survival.
- Replicate as part of the organism's regular cell cycle.
- Carry regulatory regions like **promoters, enhancers**, and **silencers** for controlling gene expression.

- Sequeces Composition
	- GC content: Plasmids and chromosomes from the same species may have different GC content. (but when split into contig this information maybe change, how about relatives in plASgraph2
- k-mers
	- 3-5 k-mers can help capture specific motifs or sequence patterns that are more frequent in plasmid (antibiotic resistance genes) or chromosome (essential genes)

What features we can extract from sequence related to plasmid and chromosome

Higher coverage depth usually indicates plasmid contigs, while more consistent coverage suggests chromosome contigs.
Plasmids may have different GC content compared to the chromosome.
Chromosome contigs are typically much longer than plasmid contigs.

Gene content analysis:

- Look for plasmid-specific genes (e.g., replication initiation proteins, mobilization proteins).
- Search for essential chromosomal genes (e.g., ribosomal proteins, DNA polymerase).

Machine learning approaches
Use features like k-mer frequencies, coverage, and GC content to train classifiers.

The confidence of edges in assembly graph can be evaluated through several factors:

Let me help you understand edge confidence in assembly graphs and strategies to improve it, drawing from my bioinformatics expertise.

The confidence of edges in assembly graphs can be evaluated through several factors:

1. Read Support

- Consistency of read pairs spanning the connection
- Quality scores of the supporting reads

2. Overlap Characteristics
