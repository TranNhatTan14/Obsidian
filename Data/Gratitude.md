# Definition

Gratitude is when you feel thankful for what you have, while appreciation is when you recognize the good qualities in something or someone.

- Gratitude is the feeling or expression of being thankful, usually directed towards people, life, or circumstances. It’s more about the overall sense of thankfulness for things, big or small. 
- Appreciation, on the other hand, is actively noticing and valuing the good qualities or benefits of something or someone. You might feel gratitude for your health and appreciate how supportive a friend has been.

- Gratitude is a deeper, more encompassing emotion or mindset that involves a sense of thankfulness for positive aspects in life, often linked with well-being and contentment. It can be directed towards people, situations, or even life as a whole. 
- Appreciation is a specific act or recognition that focuses on noticing and acknowledging value or qualities in someone or something. While gratitude has an emotional component that can be more internal and broad, appreciation is more about actively engaging and recognizing details in a person, thing, or experience.
