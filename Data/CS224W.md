Complex data can be represented as a graph of relationships between object. Such networks are a fundamental tool for modeling social, technological and biological systems.

Focus on the computational algorithmic, and modeling challenges specific to the analysis of massive graphs.
By means of studying the underlying graph structure and its features, students are introducted to machine learning techniques and data mining tools to reveal insights on a variety of network.

# Introduction

Graphs are a general language for describing and analyzing entities with relations and interactions.

Complex domains have a rich relational structure which can be represented as a relational graph.
The model ML toolbox process tensors, e.g. images (2D), text/speech (1D). Modern deep learning toolbox is designed for simple sequences and grids. Not everything can be represented as a sequence of a grid. How can we develop neural network that are much more broadly *applicable*? We can use graph. Graph connect things

- GNN is the 3rd most popular keyword in ICLR 22
- Graph learning is also very difficult due to *the complex and less structure nature of graph*
- Graph learning is also associated with representation learning. In some case it may be possible to learn a d-dimensional embedding for each node in the graph such that similar nodes have closer embeddings.

A number of different tasks can be executed on graph data

- Node level prediction
- Edge/Link level prediciton
- Graph level prediction

# Graph

A graph has several components

- Objects N: Nodes, vertices
- Interaction E: Edges, links
- System G(N, E): Networks, graphs

There is a ubiquitous representation in a particular case. Some times there is not. The choice of representation determines what information can be mined from the graph. A graph may also have some other propeties:

- Undirected/Directed edges
- Allow/Disallow multi-graphs (multiple edges between nodes)
- Heterogeneous graphs: A graph G(V, E, R, T) where edges have relation types and nodes have types with relation types. ==Drug-protein interaction graph is heterogeneous==
- Bipartite graphs: Author-Paper graph, actors-films graph

Most real-world setworks are spare. The adjacency matrix is a spare matrix with mostly 0's
