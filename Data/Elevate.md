Speaking Strategies

Speakers and writers employ a variety of linguistic techniques to help persuade an audience of an idea or elicit an emotional response.
Greek and Roman writes and orators devorted a great deal of study to rhetoric, or the art of persuasive speaking, and many speakers today, from politicians on the campain trail and executives in the boardroom to students in class and people in the workplace, employ the strategies they described to engage their audiences. Becoming familiar with common rhetorical devices will help you better understand speeches as well as more effectively craft your own. 

There are a wide range of rhetorical strategies that can help you more effectively communicate your ideas and engage your audience

### Emphasis training

Emphasize words to change the meaning of sentences

Varying your voice

As you draft a speech or presentation, consider the meaning you would like the audience to understand from each sentence. Think about which words to emphasize to achieve that meaning.

Vary your volume, pitch, and rhythm, This not only helps you shape emphasis and meaning, it also keeps listeners more engaged by making sure your speech doesn't feel monotonous.

As you practice your speech, make sure you are't emphasizing to many words. Doing so will distract the audience and keep you from achieving your desired effect.

- I didn't say your speech was boring
	- It definitely wasn't me
	- Emphatically, I did not
	- I never uttered this out loud
	- If I said a speech was boring, it wasn't yours
	- my critique of your speech did not include that it was boring

Practice changing where your emphasis falls in a sentence to shape meaning in dramatic or subtle ways.
