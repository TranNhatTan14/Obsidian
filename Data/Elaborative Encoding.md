# Definition

- Elaborative encoding is a memory technique where you link new information with existing [[Knowledge]] to help remember it.
- By making connections or adding meaning, your brain can recall the information more easily later.
- For instance, when learning a new fact, associating it with a story or a [[personal experience]] makes it stick better.
