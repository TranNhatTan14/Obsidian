# [[OKR|Objectives and Key Results]]

**Objective: Characterize Genetic Population Structure**

Key Results:
1. ==Determine optimal number of genetic clusters (K)==
- Target: Validate K value through Evanno method statistical analysis
- Metric: Delta K statistic and log probability evaluation

2. Assess genetic diversity and population composition
- Target: Generate comprehensive population genetic clustering report
- Metric: Proportion of individuals assigned to each genetic cluster

3. Validate analysis reproducibility
- Target: Ensure consistent results across multiple replicate runs
- Metric: Low standard deviation in log probability values

4. Provide actionable insights for genetic management
- Target: Develop clear recommendations based on genetic structure findings
- Metric: Detailed interpretation of population genetic relationships

**Success Criteria:** Precise identification of genetic clusters and comprehensive understanding of population genetic structure.
