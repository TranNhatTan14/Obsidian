## Body Scan

- Check in with how your body is feeling
- Body Scanning leads to greater relaxation
	- It's is common to carry stress in your body in the form of s tiff neck, tense shoulders, or a knotted stomach
	- When that happens, you may feel the physical discomfort without realizing it's connected to your emotions. The Body Scan helps you identify the physical sensations of stress and the reasons behind them. This leads to relaxation in your body and mind.
- Help manage pain
	- When you're in pain, it can feel like the sensation is overtaking your body and consuming your thoughts.
	- The Body Scan help you separate the physical sensation of pain from the emotional and cognitive experience of pain. Studies have shown that doing so can reduce pain severity and improve quality of life.
- Body Scan leads to increased understanding
	- BD builds your ability to notice physical sensations.
	- The practice of just noticing sensation,  without trying to chage them, improves your understanding of your body and what's going on with it. Over time, this will lead to a greater understanding of how to better support and take care of your physical well-being
	- Notice whatever sensation is there
