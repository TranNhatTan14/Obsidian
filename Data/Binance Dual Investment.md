### **Example of Both Return Directions (Dual Investment)**

### **Scenario 1: "Sell High" Product (BTC)**

- **Initial Investment:** 1 BTC
- **Target Price:** $52,000 (You plan to sell your 1 BTC at $52,000)
- **Settlement Date Price (Direction 1):** Market price is **$55,000**  
- **Settlement Date Price (Direction 2):** Market price is **$48,000**

#### **Direction 1: Market Price Above Target ($55,000)**
- **What Happens:**  
   - You will **sell your 1 BTC at $52,000** (the Target Price), even though the market price is $55,000.
   - The additional gain from $55,000 is **missed**.
- **Outcome:**  
   - You receive **$52,000 in BUSD** (or another designated currency) + **interest yield** earned from your investment during the period.

#### **Direction 2: Market Price Below Target ($48,000)**
- **What Happens:**  
   - You will still **sell your 1 BTC at $52,000**, despite the market price being only $48,000.
   - The price drop doesn't affect the price you get for your BTC.
- **Outcome:**  
   - You receive **$52,000 in BUSD** (or other currency) + **interest yield** earned.
   - The downside risk of a lower price is mitigated, as you're locked into the $52,000 price.

### **Scenario 2: "Buy Low" Product (BNB)**

- **Initial Investment:** 330 USDT (You plan to buy 1 BNB at $330)
- **Target Price:** $330 (You want to buy 1 BNB when it hits this price)
- **Settlement Date Price (Direction 1):** Market price is **$300**  
- **Settlement Date Price (Direction 2):** Market price is **$345**

#### **Direction 1: Market Price Below Target ($300)**
- **What Happens:**  
   - You will **buy 1 BNB at $330**, even though the market price is lower at $300.
   - You effectively **pay more** than the market value.
- **Outcome:**  
   - You receive **1 BNB** + **interest yield** (likely earned in USDT or BNB).
   - You're overpaying by $30 compared to the market price, so the potential loss comes from buying at a higher price.

#### **Direction 2: Market Price Above Target ($345)**
- **What Happens:**  
   - You will **still buy 1 BNB at $330**, even though the market price is higher at $345.
   - The advantage here is that you're buying below the market price.
- **Outcome:**  
   - You receive **1 BNB** at $330 + **interest yield** (likely in USDT or BNB).
   - You make a **profit** from getting the BNB at a cheaper price than the current market value.

### **Summary of Both Directions:**

- **"Sell High" Product:**
   - **Price Above Target:** Miss out on higher returns, but still sell at the Target Price.
   - **Price Below Target:** You are protected from selling below your Target Price, which is a benefit in a falling market.
- **"Buy Low" Product:**
   - **Price Below Target:** You overpay for the asset, buying it at a higher price than the market.
   - **Price Above Target:** You profit, buying the asset below the current market price.
